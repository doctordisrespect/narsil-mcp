# Security-Focused Preset Configuration
# Optimized for security auditing and supply chain analysis
#
# This preset includes:
# - Repository and file operations (for reading code)
# - Symbol search (for finding vulnerable functions)
# - Security scanning (OWASP Top 10, CWE Top 25, secrets, crypto)
# - Supply chain analysis (SBOM, vulnerability checks, license compliance)
# - Code analysis (taint analysis, type checking for security bugs)
# - Git integration (for finding when vulnerabilities were introduced)
#
# Expected tool count: ~35 tools
# Use case: Security auditing, vulnerability assessment, compliance

version: "1.0"
