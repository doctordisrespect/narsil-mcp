# Workflow: Code Review

Use narsil-mcp to review code changes effectively, understanding context and implications.

## The Scenario

A pull request is ready for review. You need to:
- Understand what changed
- Check for bugs or issues
- Verify the changes won't break existing functionality
- Assess code quality and complexity

## Example Conversation

### Step 1: See what changed

**You:** "Show me what files were modified recently"

**Claude calls:**
```
get_modified_files(repo: "myproject")
get_recent_changes(repo: "myproject", days: 7)
```

**Result:**
```
Modified files:
  M src/api/orders.py
  M src/services/payment.py
  A src/services/refund.py
  M tests/test_orders.py

Recent commits:
  abc123 - Add refund functionality (2 days ago)
  def456 - Update payment service (3 days ago)
```

**Claude responds:** "The recent changes add refund functionality. 3 modified files and 1 new file. Let me review each..."

---

### Step 2: Understand the new code

**You:** "Show me the new refund service"

**Claude calls:**
```
get_file(repo: "myproject", path: "src/services/refund.py")
find_symbols(repo: "myproject", file_pattern: "refund.py")
get_complexity(repo: "myproject", function: "process_refund")
```

**Result:**
```
Symbols in refund.py:
  - class RefundService
  - method process_refund (complexity: 6)
  - method validate_refund (complexity: 3)
  - method notify_customer (complexity: 2)

Cyclomatic complexity of process_refund: 6 (acceptable)
```

**Claude responds:** "The new RefundService has clean separation of concerns. `process_refund` has moderate complexity (6) - acceptable for a payment flow. Let me check the logic..."

---

### Step 3: Check how it integrates

**You:** "How does this integrate with the existing payment service?"

**Claude calls:**
```
get_dependencies(repo: "myproject", path: "src/services/refund.py")
get_callers(repo: "myproject", function: "process_refund")
find_call_path(repo: "myproject", from: "handle_refund_request", to: "process_refund")
```

**Result:**
```
refund.py imports:
  - from .payment import PaymentService
  - from ..models.order import Order

Callers of process_refund:
  - api/orders.py:handle_refund_request() at line 156

Call path:
  handle_refund_request() → validate_order() → process_refund()
```

**Claude responds:** "The refund service correctly uses the existing PaymentService. The call path is clean: API handler validates, then delegates to the refund service."

---

### Step 4: Review for security

**You:** "Are there any security concerns with the new code?"

**Claude calls:**
```
scan_security(repo: "myproject", path: "src/services/refund.py")
trace_taint(repo: "myproject", path: "src/services/refund.py", line: 45)
```

**Result:**
```
No critical/high findings in refund.py

Taint analysis:
  refund_amount flows from request.json['amount'] (user input)
  → validated by validate_refund()
  → bounded by original order amount
```

**Claude responds:** "Security looks good. User input (refund amount) is validated and bounded by the original order amount before processing."

---

### Step 5: Check the diff

**You:** "What exactly changed in the payment service?"

**Claude calls:**
```
get_commit_diff(repo: "myproject", commit: "def456", path: "src/services/payment.py")
get_blame(repo: "myproject", path: "src/services/payment.py", start_line: 80, end_line: 120)
```

**Result:**
```diff
+ def process_refund(self, order_id: str, amount: Decimal) -> RefundResult:
+     """Process a refund for an order."""
+     order = self.get_order(order_id)
+     if amount > order.total:
+         raise ValueError("Refund exceeds order total")
+     return self.gateway.refund(order.payment_id, amount)
```

**Claude responds:** "The payment service added a `process_refund` method. It correctly validates the refund amount against the order total. The implementation delegates to the payment gateway."

---

### Step 6: Check test coverage

**You:** "Are the new features tested?"

**Claude calls:**
```
search_code(query: "def test_refund", repo: "myproject")
get_file(repo: "myproject", path: "tests/test_orders.py", start_line: 100, end_line: 150)
```

**Result:**
```
Found tests:
  - test_refund_success (tests/test_orders.py:105)
  - test_refund_exceeds_total (tests/test_orders.py:118)
  - test_refund_invalid_order (tests/test_orders.py:130)
```

**Claude responds:** "Good test coverage. Tests cover:
- Happy path (successful refund)
- Error case (refund exceeds total)
- Error case (invalid order)

Consider adding tests for partial refunds and concurrent refund attempts."

---

### Step 7: Identify impact

**You:** "What other code might be affected by these changes?"

**Claude calls:**
```
find_symbol_usages(repo: "myproject", symbol: "PaymentService")
get_callers(repo: "myproject", function: "get_order", transitive: true)
```

**Result:**
```
PaymentService used in:
  - api/orders.py (import + usage)
  - api/subscriptions.py (import + usage)
  - services/refund.py (import + usage)
  - tests/test_payment.py (mocking)

get_order callers:
  - process_order (orders.py)
  - process_refund (payment.py)
  - cancel_subscription (subscriptions.py)
```

**Claude responds:** "The changes could affect subscriptions if they share order handling. Verify `cancel_subscription` still works correctly. The PaymentService mock in tests should be updated."

---

### Step 8: Check code quality

**You:** "Any code quality issues?"

**Claude calls:**
```
find_dead_code(repo: "myproject", path: "src/services/refund.py")
check_type_errors(repo: "myproject", path: "src/services/refund.py")
find_dead_stores(repo: "myproject", path: "src/services/refund.py")
```

**Result:**
```
Dead code: None found
Type errors: None detected
Dead stores:
  - Line 67: `old_status` assigned but never read
```

**Claude responds:** "Minor issue: Line 67 has an unused variable `old_status`. Either remove it or use it for logging."
